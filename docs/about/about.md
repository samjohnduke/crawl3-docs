# Objective

Web content scraping is a difficult task, and no framework or library that I have used 
has felt _right_. They all solve the problem differently. I have written crawl3 as I want
a crawler to be written. Extensible, but with solid defaults and modular so that if I 
need specific functionality, I don't need to rebuild the whole application, just a small
part.
